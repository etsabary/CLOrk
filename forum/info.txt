Silver Linings Playbook
hey dumb-dumb, she really likes you, message her to let her know you’re still on.
hey, how are you? Are you available around 4:30 Saturday afternoon? The band starts playing at the winery around 6:00.

Hey, how are you? I'm just checking to see if we're still on for Saturday at Chateau Tebeau (the winery). I'll pick you up at 4:30, if we are. Band is scheduled to play at 6:00.

then what is the point? Why are you on a dating site; why do you engage in conversations when shortly afterwards, you fade away?
Maybe he means THIS.
oh no
how's it going
treated as an option instead of a priority.
Forget it, I am not doing that this time, I can't bear to let this person get away AGAIN, so throw the rulebook out the window.
have a good day, friend
just friends
I don’t want to pull you away from your husband.
take the lead,
not my f****ing problem, I don’t want to deal with them, it’s beneath me, and it’s a peasant’s job.
I could never do it (or maybe I don't know how to do it.

let's see if he does this.
pursuing you
gender of interest
hey I’m sorry to interrupt the conversation but…
hey watch where you put your hands
OH S#!T! SORRY!
hey could go dance with that woman in the corner there? She's not dancing much and it would be good if she did.
I get it, Jody, you're afraid to be alone with me. That's why you're bailing on Saturday. You don't trust yourself to be around me, just the two of us.
lip service
hey, if you need to brush up on a few things from the private lease is, seek me out and I’ll hang around for ya.
get me a beer as long as you're in the kitchen
Oh, well, we're together and busy, and you're not with anyone. We need you to do (X) for us because we have better things to do than that.
hey you need to go talk to them, she's really down to earth and nice.
a little
mom certified, mom approved.

Since you're home with your grandkids, why don't I get some pizzas for all of you and bring them over and keep you company one night this week after work?
sure.
Hell, no,
awwww
He's never asked me out or told me he's interested.
Can I get a hug?
hey, stupid, you messed up something good.
ah man, she just being flakey
There are some things, though, that are best left unsaid, and we just have to take the word of whoever it is that said it. In this case, an honest person, Jody, told me.
wired up.
HEY, YOU'RE JUST A NO GOOD (pick your phrase)!!!
whoops, guess you didn't do anything wrong, sorry.
being a pain in the bum
I'm going through something similar.

I have a boyfriend
But I digress.
Not To Pursue.
every girl's crazy for a sharp dressed man.

hey, you look good today.
hey, are there places you've been to that are good? I'm looking to try something new with a few of my friends.

why did I take him along
hey, I really like your cousin, can you tell me more about him because he's an interesting guy.
FYI
impress
miss the window of time
it's okay if you date her
then forget about her and move on
how pretty

Can't do this, can't do that, I don't like this or that, but we can do this because I like it.
just a friend?
much hurting on the inside and afraid to trust
but she's been really nice to you. She went out of her way to go talk to you (she really didn't, I was just in the path of her belongings that night). She's been very encouraging and said you'll do well at competition.
she's his

too good to be true.
JUST BE FRIENDS
back together,
how the hell did he score all that?
let your yes be yes and your no be no.
My cousin has found someone special and I havn't won the woman I've tried for 2+ years, so that makes me feel ten times worse.
crazy
oh shit, another player.
thank you
get out of here, she's my girl
REALLY LIKE
oh shit, I better say something to him right away
Just wait until my foot heals up better! Thanks for the dance and for dancing with everyone!
that guy thinks the world of me, how rare is that, so if I had any brains, I should really at LEAST get to know him and probably a lot more.
supposed to
the relationship isn’t like what it was before. Things can happen and grow, but we don’t know what to expect.
you have to wait until I secure the woman that I like first before you get your turn.
IT'S A TEST! AND THEY'LL CONTINUE TESTING YOU TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE SAFE BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN HURT BY OTHER GUYS! YOU JUST HAVE TO BE FRIENDS FOR AWHILE!
wait until after I hook up with Angela, Herk, then you can have someone.
thank you for being my friend
perfect.
hello love.
hands off
The relationship isn't like what it was before.
Things can happen and grow...
